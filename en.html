              Ismoil Somoni peak - the highest point in the territory of the former USSR, is included in the list of ascents to fulfill the Snow Leopard standard. It is located in Tajikistan in the northwestern Pamirs at the junction of the ridges of the Academy of Sciences and Peter I. At 13 kilometers from the peak of Ismoil Somoni there is Korzhenevskaya peak. In 1931, the mountain was called Stalin peak, in 1961 it was renamed to Communism peak, and in 1999 year, the Tajik authorities renamed it again and named Ismoil Somoni peak. There are more than 30 routes to the peak of Communism (I. Somoni). The most difficult ones are from the Belyaev Glacier. There is a steep rock wall of the south-western exposure, with a length of about two kilometers, of which 600-800 meters (called the “belly”) have a slope close to 90 degrees.

The peak is one of the five seven-thousanders of the former USSR. The peak was opened on August 23, 1910 by the Russian geographer Nikolai Korzhenevsky, who named it in honor of his wife Evgenia Korzhenevskaya. The first attempt to climb the summit was made in 1937 during the Pamir expedition of the All-Union Committee on Physical Culture and Sports. The first ascent was carried out on August 22, 1953 by a group led by Alexei Ugarov along the northern ridge from the Korzhenevskaya glacier. The first woman to reach the summit was Tamara Postnikova: the climb was made in 1966 in the team of the Kazakh "Petrel" as part of the expedition of the TurkME.
