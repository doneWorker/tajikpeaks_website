In 1931, the mountain was called Stalin peak, in 1961 it was renamed to Communism peak, and in 1999 year, the Tajik authorities renamed it again and named Ismoil Somoni peak. There are more than 30 routes to the peak of Communism (I. Somoni). The most difficult ones are from the Belyaev Glacier. There is a steep rock wall of the south-western exposure, with a length of about two kilometers, of which 600-800 meters (called the “belly”) have a slope close to 90 degrees.
